# Introduction

nvim-cmp Lua LaTeX Symbols is a completion source for
[nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) that provides sources for LaTeX
symbols. This is especially useful for editing
[TeX](#only-for-certain-file-types) file types. It gets them from this URL:
https://milde.users.sourceforge.net/LUCR/Math/data/unimathsymbols.txt. *The
purpose of this plugin is to provide a 100% Lua alternative to
[cmp-latex-symbols](https://github.com/kdheepak/cmp-latex-symbols).*
cmp-latex-symbols uses Julia code to generate the symbols list, whereas this
plugin sticks to Lua instead.

# Installation

## [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

``` lua
require "packer".startup(function(use)
	use "amarakon/nvim-cmp-lua-latex-symbols"
end)
```

# Setup

The following code block shows the default options.

``` lua
require "cmp".setup {
	sources = {
		-- The `cache` option is used to determine whether to generate the list
		-- of symbols every time you start Neovim, or if it should be stored in
		-- a cache file to save time. I strongly do not advise changing this
		-- option because the data used for this plugin has not been updated
		-- since 2011.
		{ name = "lua-latex-symbols", option = { cache = true } }
	}
}
```

## Only for certain file types

``` lua
-- Only enable `lua-latex-symbols` for `tex` and `plaintex` file types
require "cmp".setup.filetype({ "tex", "plaintex" }, {
	sources = {
		{ name = "lua-latex-symbols"}
	}
})
```

# Issues

- There are certain instances where you will see two different symbols with the
  same name. Most of the time, only the first symbol is useful. I plan to remove
  duplicates in the future.
